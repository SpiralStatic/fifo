# FIFO
Welcome to the wonderful world of FIFO. FIFO is a 2-player stack removal game created during my training as a Web Developer at Sparta Global.

## Basics

### Aim
The aim of the game is to play against an opponent, to see who can remove the most blocks in the time limit. There are multiple types(colour) blocks and the player must chose the correct key relating to the correct block on the bottom row.


### Controls
Each player simply has a set of four keys that are assigned to each colour block. By pressing these keys when the lowest block is the same color, the block will be removed and the player will receive a single point.

__Beware though as clicking wrong will remove a point!__

## Settings
There are a variety of settings to tailor your experience including:
* Number of Stacks: Can either choose from a single or double stacks
* Similarity: Both players can either have the exact same stacks or have unique ones
* Power-Ups: Power up your day with some unique power-ups that can move you ahead

Just choose what you wish from the menu area.

## About
This game was created over a few days as a small web project at my time during Sparta Global. It had a few requirements/restrictions including:
* Being 2-player (Player vs Player) or (Player vs Computer)
* Built with HTML, CSS/SCSS, JS(Jquery)
* Basic frameworks are Welcome
* No canvas or 3D
* Got to be fun!

## Credits
For this project I used a few resources from elsewhere and I would like to duly credit them.
